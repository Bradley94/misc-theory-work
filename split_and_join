TASK:
Find all words that end in "s" and print them together separated 
by an underscore.

COMMENTS:
This is quite roughly put together and I'm sure could be done much more 
neatly. I'll aim to return to this code in future and create a part 2
potentially also using list comprehension.

# This below was my original solution before utilising the more 
# efficient/sensible join() method.

# txt = ''
# for x in new_list:
#   txt += x + "_"

# final_txt = txt.rstrip("_")
